Creating a Morse code decoder using sound involves capturing audio input, analyzing the sound patterns, and translating them into Morse code. In Python, you can achieve this using the sounddevice library for audio input and a signal processing approach.
This Python script uses the sounddevice library to capture audio input and then decodes Morse code based on amplitude thresholds. Adjust the dot_duration and sound_threshold variables according to your Morse code signal characteristics. Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and real-world applications ma require more sophisticated signal processing techniques. Additionally, Morse code signals may vary, so you might need to adapt the script based on the specific characteristics of the signals you're working with.
